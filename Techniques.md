### Basic Techniques
#### 1. Carving
Carving is how you will move left and right while riding a snowboard. You will use the edge of your snowboard to make turns. You can do this by leaning towards your toes to turn where you are facing and leaning towards your heels to turn where your back is facing.
This takes some practice and comes with the danger of **__catching an edge__**. Although scary at first, as you get used to carving you will be able to avoid catching edges.
To make sharper turns it sometimes helps to "kick" your back foot. For example if leaning on your heel edge, it could help to push your back heel forwards to get a more agressive turn angle.
