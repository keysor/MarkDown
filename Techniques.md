### Stance
> It's important to figure out how you perfer to stance up on the board. I often tell people to run and jump on an imaginary board. Which foot lands forward?
`Regular (Left foot forward) or Goofy (Right foot forward)`

### Basic Techniques
#### 1. Carving
Carving is how you will move left and right while riding a snowboard. You will use the edge of your snowboard to make turns. You can do this by leaning towards your toes to turn where you are facing and leaning towards your heels to turn where your back is facing.
This takes some practice and comes with the danger of **catching an edge**. Although scary at first, as you get used to carving you will be able to avoid catching edges.
To make sharper turns it sometimes helps to "kick" your back foot. For example if leaning on your heel edge, it could help to push your back heel forwards to get a more agressive turn angle.

#### 2. Stopping
It's important to be able to stop. This could save you from getting injured so it's important to practice.
- **Heel-side Stop**: Shift your weight onto your heels as if you were going to carve, now lean **back slightly** and shove that back foot forward to bring your board adjacent to your direction of travel. Now dig that back edge into the snow making sure you're leaning slightly backwards to not fall.
- **Toe-side Stop**: Shift your weight onto your toes as if you were going to carve, now lean **forward slightly** and shove your back foot backwards to bring your board adjacent to your direction of travel. Again, dig that edge in and lean forward slightly so you don't fall!
As you practice you will get more comfortable and efficient with these maneuvers, don't be afraid to fall.

#### 3. Falling Safely
Of course you're going to fall, everyone does, even experts. Here's how you can keep yourself safe:
- **Falling forward**: Try not to reach out with your hands, you could injure your wrists if you absorb your fall with your hands. Instead try dropping your forearms!
- **Falling backwards**: Again try not to reach out with your hands, if you can use your forearms again, otherwise tuck in and roll.
-  If you're moving quickly rolling can greatly reduce your chance of injury.

#### 4. General tips
- Practice on easy slopes: You can always progress to a bigger more difficult slope as you get more comfortable. Try to nail the basics on each slope.
- Start with wide, easy turns: Slowly work your way towards sharper more agressive turns.
- Look where you want to go: Stay focused! There are other people on the slope and sometimes obstacles such as the ski lift or trees.
- Layer up: You'll want to be comfortable while on the slopes. Dressing for the weather is helpful, this will help cushion your falls as well!
- Strech and warmup before your ride: My snowboarding partner always forgot, as did I; however, he always complained about being sore after a few hours of riding.
> **Have fun**: Snowboarding is a lot of fun, take it easy and relax.
